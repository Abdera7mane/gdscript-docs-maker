# Collect the reference from the Godot editor #

Godot, since version 3.2, has a tool to create a class reference from GDScript code, through its language server.

This folder contains a tool script to run directly from within your Godot projects and get the class reference as JSON.

You can find detailed instructions inside the GDScript code itself.
